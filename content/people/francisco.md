Francisco started the PhD program at the Department of Engineering and Public Policy in the Fall of 2015. His current research aims to use statistical models to study the impact of climate change on demand for electricity. Francisco previously worked for six years as an analyst at PSR, a consultancy firm in the Brazilian power sector. At PSR, he helped develop models to support the decision making process on issues related to financial and economic evaluation of generation projects, strategic bidding in energy auctions, and optimization of renewable portfolios under uncertainty. Francisco holds a M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University and a B.A. and a M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Pontificia Universidade Catolica in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
