abstract = "Data fusion can be defined as the process of combining data or information for estimating the state of an entity. Data fusion is a multi-disciplinary field that has several benefits, such as enhancing the confidence, improving reliability and reducing ambiguity of measurements for estimating the state of entities in engineering systems. It can also enhance completeness of fused data that can be required for estimating the state of engineering systems. Data fusion has been applied to different fields, such as robotics, automation, and intelligent systems. This paper reviews some examples of recent applications of data fusion in civil engineering and presents some of the potential benefits of using data fusion in civil engineering."
